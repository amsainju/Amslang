Problems:
	does not work if there is comment in the lastline
	precedence 
	associativity
	escape sequence not working while printing

Remaining Tasks:
	1) Array
	2) Dictionary
	3) Lambda
	4) Delay evaluation of function arguments
	

Requirements:

   1. comments -Done											
   2. integers and strings -Done
   3. dynamically typed (like Scheme and Python) -Done
   4. dictionaries with O(logn)	worst-case access time
   5. arrays with O(1) access time
   6. conditionals -Done
   7. recursion -Done
   8. iteration	-Done
   9. convenient means to print to the console -Done
   10. an adequate set of operators -Done
   11. anonymous functions
   12. functions as first-class objects (i.e. functions can be manipulated as in Scheme - e.g. local functions) -Done
   13. (graduate only) delayed evaluation of function arguments
